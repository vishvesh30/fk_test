You are not going to get a case and tempered glass at low price easily i thought of mentioning it because its a full glass body so we have to use some protective elements .\n2. The performance throughout the 2 months of usage was awesome never lagged any where but there was slight heating at certain circumstances during heavy gaming but its okey after the last update of jan 5th there aint any such issues any more.\n3. The portrait mode is limited to 50 cms it wrong to point it out because it has only single cam but still .\n4. Front cam is ok ok has wide aperture but lacks in details as it is 5mp only but still its better.\n5. No face unlock security.\n6. You cant use dual sim with a memory card as its hybrid but im using a extender slot which comes handy around 150rs .\nWell thats it\nIts beast with minor cons which can be ignored.\n\nAt this price range u may get op5t as well as the new honor v10 but still s7 is s7 i dont want to compare it with any of them because s7 is a great device u will not understand unless u get hold of it. It has many features u have to dig into the settings there are many features which u will understand if u get hold of it . My personal suggestion go for s7 i have used many other brands such as zenfone zoom from highend , honor 6x from budget segment but s7 satisfied me in every possible feature it gave me .\nThank you for reading it", "Review_user": "Bharat Tati", "Review_date": "18/01/2018", "Stars": "5"}, {"Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_title": "Terrific purchase", "Review_text": "Excellent deal Of gr8 mobile.The device is manufactured in September 2017 only with Nougat Update .So anyone giving negative feedbacks is fake.Flipkart is totally trustworthy", "Review_user": "Shivam Sharma", "Review_date": "22/09/2017", "Stars": "5"}, {"Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_title": "Brilliant", "Review_text": "If you are looking to buy the best mobile of 2016 in non phablet category (<5.5 inch) , buy galaxy s7. All of you know the specs, I am sharing my real world experience with galaxy s7.\n\nPros - 1. Display and design- it is breathtaking. This is the real beauty. It is amazing to hold, light weight, brilliant display. You cannot expect anything better. Super amoled display of Samsung is still the best display. QHD resolution is cherry on the cake. You will love it.\n2. Camera- s7 has arguably the best camera of 2016.google pixel is also awesome. But considering we have to pay almost 14k extra on google pixel in India, I do not think it is worth it. So better go with s7. It has amazing camera performance in both artificial and low light conditions too. So unless you are a professional photographer, you will be amazed by the camera performance.\n3. Processor and ram - As it has exynos 8890 processor and 4GB ram combination. So it performs really well. You will not feel any lag in day to day performance.\nIt can handle any game with ease.\n4. Battery - Though it's battery is not as good as s7 edge. But it is still respectable in flagship category. Pixel, nexus6p, iphone7 all of them have inferior battery.\nScreen on time when mobile data in on is around 270-300 mins.\nIt also supports fast charging when you can charge in 80mins. But even without fast charging , it gets charged in under 2hrs.\nFor medium users it will last 1 day. So do not expect anything miraculous. But Battery will not disappoint you.\n5. Storage - out of 32GB, we get around 24GB free.\n6. Fingerprint scanner works really well. It is as good as nexus 5x/6p .\n7. Supports voLTE. I have used Jio sim , it works without any issue.\n8. Call quality and network reception - I use airtel 4g as my primary sim. I have not faced any network issues.\n9. IP68 certified.\n10. NFC present.\n11. S7 supports Wireless charging. iPhone 7, pixel does not support wireless charging.\n\nCons- 1.no support to daydream - I think this is the biggest con of s7 and s7 edge.\n2. No USB type c .\n2. Battery is above average in premium category but still not best like s7 edge. I do not feel the doze feature of android 6.0 performs like it should be. I have used nexus 5x and can vouch that doze feature performs better on nexus 5x than s7. The battery drop while non use is not upto my liking on s7.\n3. Earphone provided is just OK.\n4. Only 1 sim works on LTE at a time. Other gets to 2G mode automatically.\n5. Multitasking on s7 is good. But not as great as those of iPhone 7 and pixel mobiles.\n6. Hybrid sim.\n\nBottomline - if you are considering buying a flagship device with best value for money. S7 is the right choice.\nI would advice to buy iphone 7 only if you prefer ios over android, otherwise iPhone is a waste of money compared to s7.\nI would not advice to buy Google pixel as it is too costly in India. Certainly not a VFM.\nI would also not advice to buy OP3(if you can afford s7), as it has no credible after sales support in India. camera, display, design, battery of s7 is better than those of OP3. Only advantage op3 has is its dash charging which charges op3 20mins faster than s7. But on the other hand you loose out on best camera, best display,25-30% longer battery life on s7, very reliable after sales support of samsung. So if budget is not a constraint , go for s7 instead of op3.\nBoth op3 and op3t are 5.5inch mobile. So s7 edge is their real competitor. Considering s7edge has even better battery apart from camera and display , so my suggestion would be to go for s7 edge , if you can afford it.\n\nYou can use s7 for next 2-3 yrs without any issues ( except daydream ) .\nS7 is a great mobile and I hope the future S series would continue this trend.", "Review_user": "Sumit Arora", "Review_date": "29/10/2017", "Stars": "5"}, {"Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_title": "Terrible product", "Review_text": "Don't take it from flipkart they are making fool by showing no cost emi.\nAnd you will end up with paying gst and many hidden cost", "Review_user": "nitesh srivastava", "Review_date": "13/10/2017", "Stars": "1"}, {"Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_title": "Nice", "Review_text": "The exchange offfer is good.but they must know the difference between a used phone and a new phone.the guy who came to pick my phone was i initially reluctant saying that my phone has \"dents\" wherein they were just minor scrathes on the back which is obvious during 18months of usage.wasted time in that.rest assured the phone is great.", "Review_user": "Robin Sebastime", "Review_date": "11/12/2017", "Stars": "3"}, {"Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_title": "Good quality product", "Review_text": "Its a very good mobile.

(pro mode brings a totally different dimension but most ppl dont take the hassle of doing it.)\n-Build quality of the phone is next to none. Although it's bigger sibling s7 edge has that flow over design at the edges that mesmerizes pppl, I would say the 2.5 D gorilla glass display of s7 is more practical. Handling is top notch and the Ip68 dust and water resistance is icing on the cake.\n-Gone are the days of ugly, finicky and sluggish samsung skins of the past and in comes the grace ux which is more of like a compliment to the OS rather than an overhauling. Yes the vanilla android is still the best option available but the work done by samsung over its ui spanning over several years finally looks to make a mark. (In a gd way ofcourse)\n-The exynos 8890 version available in Indian market leads its snapdragon 820 counterpart in many of the tests done by many reviewers so that's an added bonus.\nAlthough the cons are small in both number as well as quality but they still make a mark owing to how gd this phone actually is.\n-The speaker quality as well as loudness is just average. (Thanks to the waterproofing)\n-The hybrid sim slot provided makes the phone to be used either with two sims or a sim and a micro SD card. (Not fair samsung)\n-The 3.5mm jack is there(thankgod) but the quality and amp is not up the mark. (My op3 easily outclasses it)\n-The glass and metal body adds to the looks but doesn't do any favours when it come to handling smudges or falls(yes samsung is providing a one time screen replacement offer for just \u20b9990 but still...)\n-The pathetic and dismal track record of samsung updating its phone long after it gets announced is a major sore point. S7 being a flagship will be among the first to get the update but it will still take a long time and in the process sometimes some versions get skipped also. Hope that samsung speed up their allotment and distribution process.\nThere you go the flagship of 2017 and arguably the best phone of the year might have lost its top position to the new and comming flagships of 2018 but given the price at which it is being offered makes it a must buy.", "Review_user": "Pranay Kashyap", "Review_date": "09/10/2017", "Stars": "4"}, {"Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_title": "Terrific", "Review_text": "Quite clearly one of the best phones I've ever used.

So op5, honor 8 pro was out of question. I was looking at moto x4 as it ticks all the right boxes but lacks only in processing power. Flipkart just made a blast and announced s7 at 29k just before moto x4 release and boy I was saved by a narrow margin. I got this with exchange of my 3yr old phone and sbi discount at 23k. It's the best smartphone I've ever owned. Excellent display, great camera, super compact design, fast charging, ip68 rating for peace of mind, Excellent audio output via audio jack, gear vr support. Although it's 1.5 year old phone but exynos 8890 was way ahead of its time and comparable to sd 821. You won't notice single glitch of hiccup in regular uses. Although I am a fan of stock android but now I feel samsung ui has lot of very useful customization and you won't need 3rd part apps to do them which is very handy. I am a very heavy user and with few tweaking I am getting 6/7 hrs of screen on time on Wi-Fi and 5/6 hours on mobile data. Phone gets heated while charging and very heavy usage on LTE but it's normal for a smartphone this powerful. 4gb ram and 32gb rom is enough for me since storing all your personal stuff on a portable device like this which can be stolen is very risky. Only gripe is front camera is not good but i am not a selfie person so its okay i guess. The plus points over honor 8 pro and oneplus 5 @23k is I got super amoled 2k screen, ois and eis in back camera, ip68 water resistance, samsung pay which is excellent feature and you should buy only for that reason If you have multiple cards you will know what I mean.

Camera is Poor with ISOCELL sensor.", "Review_text": "Dont buy it for Camera. Camera is Poor(compared to price(20k~30k) and praise everywhere on Internet about camera) with ISOCELL sensor.\nEverything else is ok but mainly purchased phone for camera and that is the biggest disappointment.\nIt takes totally faded images. On mobile screen it may look ok but if you see on LCD monitor you can clearly find that camera is just very poor. Details and sharpness are there but color is too poor in all lighting conditions. It lacks color contrast. You need to use snapseed to get something useful. Selfie camera is just poor.\nOther phones in less than 10k(like cool1 dual) take better coloured(but not better sharpness and details) pictures than this so called past year's flagship from Samsung. All images are oversharpened and so on mobile screen it may give fake feeling of lots of details. But when you see on computer screen, you will feel cheated. Camera is fast and captures details. But no colours. All images are smearing and faded.\nCamera has option to store raw image when using pro mode. I feel that also lacks good colour capture. Default camera just over sharpens and over process it.\n\nFlipkart is good. But Samsung cheated by putting life less ISOCELL sensor for camera instead of Sony IMX sensor. Mostly good coloured images you see on Internet is because of any of the three reasons mostly:\n1) Image is edited to enhance colours.\nOR\n2) Sony IMX sensor is used instead of ISOCELL. No matter what other paid/biased reviewers comment on this, fact is that Sony IMX sensor variant S7 takes better images than ISOCELL variant. S7 captures mediocre colours. Colours are very important image quality. Samsung should mention camera sensor name exactly the way they mention cpu name. Especially when they highlight camera as one of the main qualities of the phone.\nOR\n3) You have not compared images side by side with other good camera phones. You have not given enough thought to it.\n\nNow other IMP points are,\n1) Fingerprint sensor is not as fast+accurate as other less than 10k phones from LeEco, Xiaomi, Coolpad, Lenovo etc. And moreover, you need to hard press it once then only it will detect fingerprint touch. You need to awake phone from sleep, then only fingerprint sensor will work. Its kind of very uncomfortable and its designed like that only. Its not always active capacitive fingerprint sensor like other regular phones.\n2) No IR blaster. Very stupid Samsung! Its more useful than barometer you put in your phone. Not everyone have smart TV. It would not cost you much. Le2 phone has IR code learning capability as well and so it can copy any non standard IR remote, Thats useful.\n3) Heated up when started the phone first time. After 2 days, heating is under 40 degree most of the time even during charging. I dont keep GPS and NFC on. But 4G internet + hotspot, does not heat up phone much. To my experience, heat management and battery back up are good. Always on display feature consumes 1 percent per hour approximately. Battery back up is not outstanding. But it is not poor as well. Its good enough. I get 2 days(Internet always on+intermittent hotspot) with 1 hour SOT easily. Once observed 5 hours 30 minutes of SoT with 24 hours on 4G. Thats sufficient for me. It does not bother me.\n4) Display is good but most of the time we use HD resolution to save battery(It has option to set display resolution to HD, FHD or QHD). So, it is like any other normal AMOLED display. But sometimes you just need a break from overly saturated unreal AMOLED display. Overall its good.\n5) Observed ocassional lags with small game like raging thunder 2. But I m sure this can be fine tuned by using performance mode or may be some small random glitch. I dont play games much. But I think that phone should be able to run most games easily. No comments on Exynos vs SD processor variants.\n6) Samsung pay seems good option. But did not try.\n\nIf buying it as a regular phone accepting pros, cons, (in between average to good camera)--- go ahead.\nIf buying it with excellent camera expectations--- You will be dissapointed after spending 30k.\nWaking up phone by hard pressing button, before using fingerprint is annoying.

Just imagine, here u need to dowload apps for things like second space, lock app. You cant record a call, at least no prov by UI.\n\n5.) Heating is an issue. Coulnt place next to my ear for a call after 3 minutes of ordinary processing.\n\n6.) No provision of blocking pesky SMS senders. Back in MIUI, you could classify them and block them.\n\nNo wonder its at some discount. Advice would be dont go for it if you looking for performance and utility.

And after using it for 15 days I think I could have even given 40 k for this phone.\nVerdict : if you want a phone with a stellar camera, you have come to the right place\n\nHere is the pros and con\nPros\nGreat Design : This is a flagship phone and has built quality is comparable to other flagship plus you get ip68 water resistance.\n\nCamera : It has an amazing camera, one which will make you click more pictures. It's superb in low light conditions and pictures has a lot of detail. Those who say that pictures are oversaturated are not right because when see them on our laptop or TV, the colours are perfectly natural. They look oversaturated on phone's screen only. So, camera don't take over saturated pictures, it's the screen of the phone that makes it look like that. Gallery app has a story feature by which it creates a video comprising of photos taken on a particular day. It's a small but pretty cool feature to have.\n\nBattery : I would consider myself to be light to a moderate user who does not play games. I am getting 5-6 hrs screen on time consistently and 1 to 1 and half day battery life. I use dual sim and use Internet mostly on wifi and use mobile data (Jio 4g) for about 4 hours a day. I think even when you use mobile data whole day, you can get 1 day battery back. I don't use always on display though.\n\nPerformance : I was an apple fan and for many years wanted to buy an iPhone but off late Android has been doing pretty well and the gap between iOS and android has lessened. This phone comes with android 7.0 out of the box with samsung ui. I would have been the last person in the world to recommend samsung's ui BUT the update Samsung launched with 7.0 has completely transformed the operating system. Its clean and light. It's fast and notifications are completely like stock android. Previously this phone came with marshmallow and then the ui was not clean but now with the update the user interface is very clean and pleasing to eyes. Initially I used a google launcher but now I am using the default launcher as it makes the icon size equal for every app. This phone works like a charm and I have no complaints about its speed.\n\nSound : there is nothing exceptional in sound department but there is nothing sub standard too. That is why I am not keeping it in the cons section.\n\nDisplay : This is my first super amoled display and boy I like it. The blacks are pitch black use a black wallpaper from Samsung theme store and you will see what amoled brings to the table.\n\nCons\n\nNo tempered glass : you cannot use a tempered glass with this phone because the screen is slightly curved not as much as the s7 edge but just enough so that you cannot put a tempered glass. Now I don't know whether it's samsung's fault or the tempered glass manufacture's fault. Either way, it's a concern.\n\nIf you are getting this phone @ 29 k then buy it blindly and please ! don't get one plus 5. It's not comparable to s7, there is a significant difference between the camera quality plus you get water resistance. All the iPhone fans who are looking for more value for their money can buy this phone @29 k because iPhone 7 plus would cost you 48 k at least. There is no point buying iPhone 7 as Galaxy s7 with its battery life and display can beat the iPhone 7 easily. The only competition this phone has is iPhone 7 plus but that is significantly expensive.

The Camera quality is superb in both Daylight and Low light. Video output is very stable even with handheld. It is still one of thr best camera even in 2017. Very satisfied with the camera.\n2. As this is a 5.1 inch device. This very easy to hold but glassback made this device slippery. So use a back case.\n3. Battery life even after Android N(7.0 not 7.1.2) update is pretty good. Better than my previous OP3 on nougat which had the same 3000 mah battery. In addition it is also has latest security patch. If you use this device at 1080p mode (can be changed from settings) then you would get better battery life. With 1080p I got 4hr 45 min of screen on time over 28 hours of usage which is great with 1440p that would be 4hr10min over 24 hours of usage. Battery standby time is great I must say. This is with Wifi and will update the battery usage on mobile data later.\n4. With Exynos 8890 cpu and MaliT880 MP12 GPU the overall performance is fluid.\nI have played Asphalt 8 and extreme at 1440p, Played AC identity at 1440p. Experience was quite great.\n5.
