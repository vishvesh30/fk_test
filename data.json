You are not going to get a case and tempered glass at low price easily i thought of mentioning it because its a full glass body so we have to use some protective elements .\n2. The performance throughout the 2 months of usage was awesome never lagged any where but there was slight heating at certain circumstances during heavy gaming but its okey after the last update of jan 5th there aint any such issues any more.\n3. The portrait mode is limited to 50 cms it wrong to point it out because it has only single cam but still .\n4. Front cam is ok ok has wide aperture but lacks in details as it is 5mp only but still its better.\n5. No face unlock security.\n6. You cant use dual sim with a memory card as its hybrid but im using a extender slot which comes handy around 150rs .\nWell thats it\nIts beast with minor cons which can be ignored.\n\nAt this price range u may get op5t as well as the new honor v10 but still s7 is s7 i dont want to compare it with any of them because s7 is a great device u will not understand unless u get hold of it. It has many features u have to dig into the settings there are many features which u will understand if u get hold of it . My personal suggestion go for s7 i have used many other brands such as zenfone zoom from highend , honor 6x from budget segment but s7 satisfied me in every possible feature it gave me .\nThank you for reading it", "Review_title": "Brilliant", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "Bharat Tati", "Review_date": "18/01/2018"}, {"Stars": "2", "Review_text": "I bought on 24th sep. sale @29990 .Everything is good about this phone but AVOID this phone .\nWHY ??\n\n1.

All of you know the specs, I am sharing my real world experience with galaxy s7.\n\nPros - 1. Display and design- it is breathtaking. This is the real beauty. It is amazing to hold, light weight, brilliant display. You cannot expect anything better. Super amoled display of Samsung is still the best display. QHD resolution is cherry on the cake. You will love it.\n2. Camera- s7 has arguably the best camera of 2016.google pixel is also awesome. But considering we have to pay almost 14k extra on google pixel in India, I do not think it is worth it. So better go with s7. It has amazing camera performance in both artificial and low light conditions too. So unless you are a professional photographer, you will be amazed by the camera performance.\n3. Processor and ram - As it has exynos 8890 processor and 4GB ram combination. So it performs really well. You will not feel any lag in day to day performance.\nIt can handle any game with ease.\n4. Battery - Though it's battery is not as good as s7 edge. But it is still respectable in flagship category. Pixel, nexus6p, iphone7 all of them have inferior battery.\nScreen on time when mobile data in on is around 270-300 mins.\nIt also supports fast charging when you can charge in 80mins. But even without fast charging , it gets charged in under 2hrs.\nFor medium users it will last 1 day. So do not expect anything miraculous. But Battery will not disappoint you.\n5. Storage - out of 32GB, we get around 24GB free.\n6. Fingerprint scanner works really well. It is as good as nexus 5x/6p .\n7. Supports voLTE. I have used Jio sim , it works without any issue.\n8. Call quality and network reception - I use airtel 4g as my primary sim. I have not faced any network issues.\n9. IP68 certified.\n10. NFC present.\n11. S7 supports Wireless charging. iPhone 7, pixel does not support wireless charging.\n\nCons- 1.no support to daydream - I think this is the biggest con of s7 and s7 edge.\n2. No USB type c .\n2. Battery is above average in premium category but still not best like s7 edge. I do not feel the doze feature of android 6.0 performs like it should be. I have used nexus 5x and can vouch that doze feature performs better on nexus 5x than s7. The battery drop while non use is not upto my liking on s7.\n3. Earphone provided is just OK.\n4. Only 1 sim works on LTE at a time. Other gets to 2G mode automatically.\n5. Multitasking on s7 is good. But not as great as those of iPhone 7 and pixel mobiles.\n6. Hybrid sim.\n\nBottomline - if you are considering buying a flagship device with best value for money. S7 is the right choice.\nI would advice to buy iphone 7 only if you prefer ios over android, otherwise iPhone is a waste of money compared to s7.\nI would not advice to buy Google pixel as it is too costly in India. Certainly not a VFM.\nI would also not advice to buy OP3(if you can afford s7), as it has no credible after sales support in India. camera, display, design, battery of s7 is better than those of OP3. Only advantage op3 has is its dash charging which charges op3 20mins faster than s7. But on the other hand you loose out on best camera, best display,25-30% longer battery life on s7, very reliable after sales support of samsung. So if budget is not a constraint , go for s7 instead of op3.\nBoth op3 and op3t are 5.5inch mobile. So s7 edge is their real competitor. Considering s7edge has even better battery apart from camera and display , so my suggestion would be to go for s7 edge , if you can afford it.\n\nYou can use s7 for next 2-3 yrs without any issues ( except daydream ) .\nS7 is a great mobile and I hope the future S series would continue this trend.", "Review_title": "Brilliant", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "Sumit Arora", "Review_date": "29/10/2017"}, {"Stars": "1", "Review_text": "Don't take it from flipkart they are making fool by showing no cost emi.\nAnd you will end up with paying gst and many hidden cost", "Review_title": "Terrible product", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "nitesh srivastava", "Review_date": "13/10/2017"}, {"Stars": "3", "Review_text": "The exchange offfer is good.but they must know the difference between a used phone and a new phone.the guy who came to pick my phone was i initially reluctant saying that my phone has \"dents\" wherein they were just minor scrathes on the back which is obvious during 18months of usage.wasted time in that.rest assured the phone is great.", "Review_title": "Nice", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "Robin Sebastime", "Review_date": "11/12/2017"}, {"Stars": "5", "Review_text": "Its a very good mobile.

Product is Amazing. Delivery was on time. Thanka Flipkart for the superb offer :)", "Review_title": "Excellent", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "Sathya Vignesh", "Review_date": "23/09/2017"}, {"Stars": "5", "Review_text": "Awesome", "Review_title": "Classy product", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "Shashi Ranjan", "Review_date": "15/10/2016"}, {"Stars": "5", "Review_text": "I purchased this product on the 21st of September'2017 and had it delivered on the 23rd. It has been approximately 10 days since I started using the phone. Here is my list of pros and cons based on real usage so far -\n\nPros -\n\n1. Look & feel - Amazing and premium. The moment you handle the phone you know it's a top of the line product. Fits well in your hand though you have to be careful as the shiny metallic exterior tends to slip out. I still cannot get over how beautiful the device looks even after 10 odd days and the looks are likely the first thing anyone will notice about the phone.\n\n2. Display - Stunning. Really, no other word needed. AMOLED looks equally stunning even when the resolution is reduced from Quad HD to FHD. Stunning indeed!\n\n3. Performance - So far so good, have tested out a few graphics intensive games. No lags so far. Handles multiple apps with ease and NO significant heating even on heavy usage. There might be a few more devices with better gaming abilities(Google Pixel et al), but I have had no complaints.\n\n4. Camera - Oh boy! Where do we start?! It has been a revelation. The camera is easily the centrepiece of this masterful device. Crisp, clear pictures with amazing details snapped with a super fast camera app. Packed with nifty features too. However, the single greatest aspect has to be the low light photography capability of this device. I remember clicking pictures inside the dingy dark rooms of an old fort only to discover details that my eyes had missed inside those dark rooms. The camera alone is worth all the hype that this device has garnered.\n\n5. Battery - With several modes and battery saving options, the battery life can be modified as per your choice and usage. Overall, nothing revolutionary but a fully charged phone coasts through the day with moderate usage and being constantly connected to a wifi network. Decent, above average performance. Oh and honestly fast charging does not heat up the device as much as in case of some other devices.\n\n6. Misc - Everything else is quite well done as you would expect from a flagship device. The Samsung touchwiz is packed with some useful & some not so useful features. It does take up more space than stock android but nothing that hampers the storage capability of the device to a great extent. Haven't really tested out the water resistant feature but likely to work well too. The fingerprint sensor works in a snap and all other sensors work quite efficiently too.\n\nCons -\n\n1. Headphones - The biggest letdown. Really, really disappointed. I have a pair of Sony headphones which make up for the lack of decent headphones. Should have received a better set with such a premium product.\n\n2. Speakers - Clear enough but single bottom mounted speakers don't really create the magic and the sound often gets muffled out while the device is held.\n\nOverall, a truly magnificent device that is also a complete value for its price especially since I got it at 24K (30k with Flipkart discount and 6k as exchange discount) & I could not have asked for anything better. Even with the advent of the mesmerizing S8 and the Note 8, this still remains a great product to purchase.", "Review_title": "Great!", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "Abhishek Mukhopadhyay", "Review_date": "03/10/2017"}, {"Stars": "5", "Review_text": "Just Stupendous", "Review_title": "Classy product", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "Flipkart Customer", "Review_date": "21/01/2018"}, {"Stars": "4", "Review_text": "Its a nice phone i am using it scince last 4 days with awesome display and performance but battery backup is not so good.

(pro mode brings a totally different dimension but most ppl dont take the hassle of doing it.)\n-Build quality of the phone is next to none. Although it's bigger sibling s7 edge has that flow over design at the edges that mesmerizes pppl, I would say the 2.5 D gorilla glass display of s7 is more practical. Handling is top notch and the Ip68 dust and water resistance is icing on the cake.\n-Gone are the days of ugly, finicky and sluggish samsung skins of the past and in comes the grace ux which is more of like a compliment to the OS rather than an overhauling. Yes the vanilla android is still the best option available but the work done by samsung over its ui spanning over several years finally looks to make a mark. (In a gd way ofcourse)\n-The exynos 8890 version available in Indian market leads its snapdragon 820 counterpart in many of the tests done by many reviewers so that's an added bonus.\nAlthough the cons are small in both number as well as quality but they still make a mark owing to how gd this phone actually is.\n-The speaker quality as well as loudness is just average. (Thanks to the waterproofing)\n-The hybrid sim slot provided makes the phone to be used either with two sims or a sim and a micro SD card. (Not fair samsung)\n-The 3.5mm jack is there(thankgod) but the quality and amp is not up the mark. (My op3 easily outclasses it)\n-The glass and metal body adds to the looks but doesn't do any favours when it come to handling smudges or falls(yes samsung is providing a one time screen replacement offer for just \u20b9990 but still...)\n-The pathetic and dismal track record of samsung updating its phone long after it gets announced is a major sore point. S7 being a flagship will be among the first to get the update but it will still take a long time and in the process sometimes some versions get skipped also. Hope that samsung speed up their allotment and distribution process.\nThere you go the flagship of 2017 and arguably the best phone of the year might have lost its top position to the new and comming flagships of 2018 but given the price at which it is being offered makes it a must buy.", "Review_title": "Delightful", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "Pranay Kashyap", "Review_date": "09/10/2017"}, {"Stars": "5", "Review_text": "Quite clearly one of the best phones I've ever used.

So op5, honor 8 pro was out of question. I was looking at moto x4 as it ticks all the right boxes but lacks only in processing power. Flipkart just made a blast and announced s7 at 29k just before moto x4 release and boy I was saved by a narrow margin. I got this with exchange of my 3yr old phone and sbi discount at 23k. It's the best smartphone I've ever owned. Excellent display, great camera, super compact design, fast charging, ip68 rating for peace of mind, Excellent audio output via audio jack, gear vr support. Although it's 1.5 year old phone but exynos 8890 was way ahead of its time and comparable to sd 821. You won't notice single glitch of hiccup in regular uses. Although I am a fan of stock android but now I feel samsung ui has lot of very useful customization and you won't need 3rd part apps to do them which is very handy. I am a very heavy user and with few tweaking I am getting 6/7 hrs of screen on time on Wi-Fi and 5/6 hours on mobile data. Phone gets heated while charging and very heavy usage on LTE but it's normal for a smartphone this powerful. 4gb ram and 32gb rom is enough for me since storing all your personal stuff on a portable device like this which can be stolen is very risky. Only gripe is front camera is not good but i am not a selfie person so its okay i guess. The plus points over honor 8 pro and oneplus 5 @23k is I got super amoled 2k screen, ois and eis in back camera, ip68 water resistance, samsung pay which is excellent feature and you should buy only for that reason If you have multiple cards you will know what I mean.

The notification light I like Huawei's better than samsung, because if phn is charging n some msg comes on samsung, it doesn't show the charging notification. It shows notification of New/Unread message.\nFinger print sensor is good. Unlocks the phone 9 out of 10 times. It really depends on how you have set the finger prints(different angels n different portions of the thumb/finger).\nI'll give it 3.5 stars. -1.5 stars for the heat-up/ charging issue.", "Review_title": "Heats up n long time to charge battery", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S7 (Gold Platinum, 32 GB)  (4 GB RAM)", "Review_user": "Sukhbir Khera", "Review_date": "31/03/2016"}, {"Stars": "5", "Review_text": "Got the product delivered 2 days before expected delivery.

It don't struggles in any lighting condition. It can capture sharp images in direct lighting, dynamic range is high but images seems to be over saturated. On artificial and low lighting condition, the cemera does a greay job,but little bit noise can be noticed.\nBut Front Camera is not upto the mark. It can't capture sharp image.

Camera is Poor(compared to price(20k~30k) and praise everywhere on Internet about camera) with ISOCELL sensor.\nEverything else is ok but mainly purchased phone for camera and that is the biggest disappointment.\nIt takes totally faded images. On mobile screen it may look ok but if you see on LCD monitor you can clearly find that camera is just very poor. Details and sharpness are there but color is too poor in all lighting conditions. It lacks color contrast. You need to use snapseed to get something useful. Selfie camera is just poor.\nOther phones in less than 10k(like cool1 dual) take better coloured(but not better sharpness and details) pictures than this so called past year's flagship from Samsung. All images are oversharpened and so on mobile screen it may give fake feeling of lots of details. But when you see on computer screen, you will feel cheated. Camera is fast and captures details. But no colours. All images are smearing and faded.\nCamera has option to store raw image when using pro mode. I feel that also lacks good colour capture. Default camera just over sharpens and over process it.\n\nFlipkart is good. But Samsung cheated by putting life less ISOCELL sensor for camera instead of Sony IMX sensor. Mostly good coloured images you see on Internet is because of any of the three reasons mostly:\n1) Image is edited to enhance colours.\nOR\n2) Sony IMX sensor is used instead of ISOCELL. No matter what other paid/biased reviewers comment on this, fact is that Sony IMX sensor variant S7 takes better images than ISOCELL variant. S7 captures mediocre colours. Colours are very important image quality. Samsung should mention camera sensor name exactly the way they mention cpu name. Especially when they highlight camera as one of the main qualities of the phone.\nOR\n3) You have not compared images side by side with other good camera phones. You have not given enough thought to it.\n\nNow other IMP points are,\n1) Fingerprint sensor is not as fast+accurate as other less than 10k phones from LeEco, Xiaomi, Coolpad, Lenovo etc. And moreover, you need to hard press it once then only it will detect fingerprint touch. You need to awake phone from sleep, then only fingerprint sensor will work. Its kind of very uncomfortable and its designed like that only. Its not always active capacitive fingerprint sensor like other regular phones.\n2) No IR blaster. Very stupid Samsung! Its more useful than barometer you put in your phone. Not everyone have smart TV. It would not cost you much. Le2 phone has IR code learning capability as well and so it can copy any non standard IR remote, Thats useful.\n3) Heated up when started the phone first time. After 2 days, heating is under 40 degree most of the time even during charging. I dont keep GPS and NFC on. But 4G internet + hotspot, does not heat up phone much. To my experience, heat management and battery back up are good. Always on display feature consumes 1 percent per hour approximately. Battery back up is not outstanding. But it is not poor as well. Its good enough. I get 2 days(Internet always on+intermittent hotspot) with 1 hour SOT easily. Once observed 5 hours 30 minutes of SoT with 24 hours on 4G. Thats sufficient for me. It does not bother me.\n4) Display is good but most of the time we use HD resolution to save battery(It has option to set display resolution to HD, FHD or QHD). So, it is like any other normal AMOLED display. But sometimes you just need a break from overly saturated unreal AMOLED display. Overall its good.\n5) Observed ocassional lags with small game like raging thunder 2. But I m sure this can be fine tuned by using performance mode or may be some small random glitch. I dont play games much. But I think that phone should be able to run most games easily. No comments on Exynos vs SD processor variants.\n6) Samsung pay seems good option. But did not try.\n\nIf buying it as a regular phone accepting pros, cons, (in between average to good camera)--- go ahead.\nIf buying it with excellent camera expectations--- You will be dissapointed after spending 30k.\nWaking up phone by hard pressing button, before using fingerprint is annoying.
